	uncompromising problems, characterised by the
	requirement that solutions must perform optimally on
	each of many test cases. Many of the problems that have
	long motivated genetic programming research, including
	the automation of many traditional programming tasks,
	are uncompromising. We describe and analyse the
	recently proposed lexicase parent selection algorition
	and show that it can facilitate the solution of
	uncompromising problems by genetic programming. Unlike
	most traditional parent selection techniques, lexicase
	selection does not base selection on a fitness value
	that is aggregated over all test cases; rather, it
	considers test cases one at a time in random order. We
	present results comparing lexicase selection to more
	traditional parent selection methods, including
	standard tournament selection and implicit fitness
	sharing, on four uncompromising problems: finding terms
	in finite algebras, designing digital multipliers,
	counting words in files, and performing symbolic
	regression of the factorial function. We provide
	evidence that lexicase selection maintains higher
	levels of population diversity than other selection
	methods, which may partially explain its utility as a
	parent selection algorithm in the context of
	uncompromising problems.",

	abstract =	"A recent article on benchmark problems for genetic
	programming suggested that researchers focus attention
	on the digital multiplier problem, also known as the
	multiple output multiplier problem, in part because it
	is scalable and in part because the requirement of
	multiple outputs presents challenges for some forms of
	genetic programming [20]. Here we demonstrate the
	application of stack-based genetic programming to the
	digital multiplier problem using the PushGP genetic
	programming system, which evolves programs expressed in
	the stack-based Push programming language. We
	demonstrate the use of output instructions and argue
	that they provide a natural mechanism for producing
	multiple outputs in a stack-based genetic programming
	context. We also show how two recent developments in
	PushGP dramatically improve the performance of the
	system on the digital multiplier problem. These
	developments are the ULTRA genetic operator, which
	produces offspring via Uniform Linear Transformation
	with Repair and Alternation [12], and lexicase
	selection, which selects parents according to
	performance on cases considered sequentially in random
	order [11]. Our results using these techniques show not
	only their utility, but also the utility of the digital
	multiplier problem as a benchmark problem for genetic
	programming research. The results also demonstrate the
	exibility of stack-based genetic programming for
	solving problems with multiple outputs and for serving
	as a platform for experimentation with new genetic
	programming techniques.",

	abstract =	"Several genetic programming researchers have argued
	for the utility of genetic operators that act
	uniformly. By act uniformly we mean two specific
	things: that the probability of an inherited program
	component being modified during inheritance is
	independent of the size and shape of the parent
	programs beyond the component in question; and that
	pairs of parents are combined in ways that allow
	arbitrary combinations of components from each parent
	to appear in the child. Uniform operators described in
	previous work have had limited utility, however,
	because of a mismatch between the relevant notions of
	uniformity and the hierarchical structure and variable
	sizes of many genetic programming representations. In
	this chapter we describe a new genetic operator, ULTRA,
	which incorporates aspects of both mutation and
	crossover and acts approximately uniformly across
	programs of variable sizes and structures. ULTRA treats
	hierarchical programs as linear sequences and includes
	a repair step to ensure that syntax constraints are
	satisfied after variation. We show that on the drug
	bioavailability and Pagie-1 benchmark problems ULTRA
	produces significant improvements both in
	problem-solving power and in program size relative to
	standard operators. Experiments with factorial
	regression and with the Boolean 6-multiplexer problem
	demonstrate that ULTRA can manipulate programs that
	make use of hierarchical structure, but also that it is
	not always beneficial. The demonstrations evolve
	programs in the Push programming language, which makes
	repair particularly simple, but versions of the
	technique should be applicable in other genetic
	programming systems as well.",

	presents a new approach to solving modal problems with

	analysis of genetic programming runs on a simple modal
	symbolic regression problem. This is a preliminary
	report that is intended in part to stimulate discussion
	on the significance of modal problems, methods for

		 that include unnecessary code. This is undesirable for
		 several reasons, including the burdens that
		 overly-large programs put on end-users for program
		 interpretation and maintenance. The problem is
		 exacerbated by recently developed techniques, such as
		 genetic programming with geometric semantic crossover,
		 that tend to produce enormous programs. Methods for
		 automatically simplifying evolved programs are
		 therefore of interest, but automatic simplification is
		 non-trivial in the context of traditional program
		 representations with unconstrained function sets. Here
		 we show how evolved programs expressed in the
		 stack-based Push programming language can be
		 automatically and reliably simplified using a simple,
		 stochastic hill-climber. We demonstrate and
		 quantitatively characterise this simplification process
		 on programs evolved to solve four non-trivial genetic
		 programming problems with qualitatively different

		 fitness. This increases resource usage, both memory and
		 CPU time, and may result in over-fitting the training
		 data. Numerical simplification is a method for removing
		 redundant code from the program trees as the run
		 proceeds. Compared with the canonical genetic
		 programming method, numerical simplification can
		 generate much smaller programs, use much shorter
		 evolutionary training times and achieve comparable
		 effectiveness performance. A key parameter of this
		 method is the simplification threshold. This paper
		 examines whether there exists any relationship between
		 the noise level in the input data and the optimum value
		 for the simplification threshold and, if it exists,
		 what that relationship is. Our results suggest that
		 there is a relationship between the optimum value of
		 the simplification threshold and the level of noise in
		 the input data and that a lower bound for the optimum
		 simplification threshold is equal to the noise level
		 and an upper bound is five times the noise level.",
